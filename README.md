# i2cStructTransfer
A Simple example for transfer Struct type variables via i2c

The proposed code helps to interface via i2c protocol an Arduino UNO and a NodeMCU to transmit data from sensors via wifi.
The sensor data must be inserted into a struct and then sent with the appropriate library function `I2C_read / writeAnything ()`
